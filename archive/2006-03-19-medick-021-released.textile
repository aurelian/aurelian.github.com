I'm very proud to annonce you that Medick version 0.2.1 has been released 15 minutes ago.

h4. Whats new?

* API docs bundled in the download package
* Medick Environments
* Minor fixes

Read the complete "changelog":http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/medick/trunk/CHANGELOG?op=file&rev=379&sc=0. Not to many new things one might say, but the most important is the fact that I spend some time on writing some cool documentation.
