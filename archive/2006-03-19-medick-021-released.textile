I'm very proud to annonce you that "medick":http://medick.locknet.ro version 0.2.1 has been "released":http://medick.locknet.ro/download/medick-0.2.1.tgz 15 minutes ago.



h3. Whats new?



* API docs bundled in the download package

* Medick Environments

* Minor fixes



Read the complete "changelog":http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/medick/trunk/CHANGELOG?op=file&rev=379&sc=0.



Not to many new things one might say, but the most important is the fact that I spend some time on writing some cool documentation:



* "The Long Intro":http://medick.locknet.ro/documentation.html still a work in progress,

* the "API":http://medick.locknet.ro/api docs,

* a small and aready outdated "screencast":http://medick.locknet.ro/getting_started.html (4MB flash movie).



h3. Update 19.March
