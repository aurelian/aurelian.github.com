WSM, Windows Service Management, is an extension to the PHP programming language, that allows you to control Windows NT Services from PHP scripts.



The project was started in December 2004 since I needed a nice way to start or stop Windows Services from "Fastwork Control Center":http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=89492. In January 2005 the project was moved to "berlios.de":http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsm/

Octomber 2005: I re-wrote the extension to give away a nice "OO API":http://wsm.berlios.de/pmwiki.php/Main/API. Also, a website powered by "PmWiki":http://www.pmwiki.org/ was launched to "http://wsm.berlios.de/":http://wsm.berlios.de/
