Last night I've got an email from a WSM user who asked about a precomipled binary of WSM for PHP 5.1 and 5.2.



So,  I'm proud to annonce release 0.9.1 of WSM.

Use the "berlios.de":http://developer.berlios.de mirrors for "download":http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2873.



WSM stands for Windows Service Management and it's an extension to PHP so you can control Windows Services from - umm, well - your PHP scripts. WSM is released under "PHP License, version 3.0":http://php.net/license/3_0.txt.



More details, including the API or the installation procedure, can be found on the WSM web site, "http://wsm.berlios.de":http://wsm.berlios.de
