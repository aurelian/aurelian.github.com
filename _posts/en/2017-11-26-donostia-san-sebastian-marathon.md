### Marathon

Flat with the exception of a small under-pass that you have to run ..4 times. Fast with a very high level of runners, checking the results of previous years yielded around 10% of the finishers under 3h.

Weather is great for running, at times it can get windy when running on that beautiful ocean promenade, it wasn't the case this year.

Organization wise they have only room for improvements.

### Training
I haven't done a specific training plan because I wasn't sure (nor convinced) that I'd end up running an autumn marathon. Recovery from an Achilles tendinitis was very slow and I wanted to hit intermediate goals before committing to the race. Main idea was to keep the weekly volume around 100KM/week with 2-3Q days/week.

There was a 10 weeks build up mixing base-building with fast workouts 10k specific from our beloved Jack Daniels. After, I switched to a Hanson's style of workouts with strength (done at 15-10k pace), MP work (12-16k) and +30k long runs. 3 weeks before I did a 32k long run with 21k (a half) in 1:29:something.

The hardest part was the mental preparation. You see, it takes milliseconds in a marathon for my mind to switch to survival mode. There's a very thin line between: "I already run a sub3, what's the point" and "I can do this". So, I had to have my mental game ready for various scenarios. If X will happen I'll do Y. And so on.

Hint: it worked.

My PRs: 38:43 (Jan.2016), 1:26:5x (Feb.2016), 2:59:32 (Apr.2016). This was my 5th marathon.

### Pre-race

Hotel was in walking distance to everything: drop-bag, start/finish line, bib pick-up (which I did Saturday), so I woke up at 6:20 for breakfast, then back to my hotel room. It was raining and pitch dark. Side note: I think Spain should be in the same timezone as UK / Portugal.

The start was at 9am, but at 8 I was still in bed listening to the rain. Finally I decide on what singlet to wear, forced a cheese cake and a strong coffee in, then headed out to drop my bag and run a marathon.

Wet a tree and warmd up to the starting corral with about 5 minutes to go.

### Race

#### Start-KM 5: 21:16
Start was slow because lots of runners entered the wrong box. My idea was to go 4:14/km (around 6:50/mile for my statute friends) up to KM16 (that's about mile 10 for same friends) or so but my legs were going like locked at 4:11/km (6:44-6:45/mile). Had to consciously slow down between km4-5.

#### KM 5 - KM10: 42:09
Started to rain, it wasn't cloudy so I knew it will soon stop. And it did. Had my first GU at KM8.

#### KM 10 - KM15: 1:03:15
I have a funny situation with the sub3 pacers as they appear out of nowhere on **bikes** and with a pace that was kinda fast for a sub3.

We're now on a long out and back section with an under-pass somewhere around KM 12 and 14 on the back.

#### KM 15 - half: 1:28:57
Second GU at km16. Looking forward to pass km 20 where the half marathoners will finish their race and we'll start the second lap. I've told you right? This is a two laps marathon with a half marathon race at the same time.

Legs are OK, I'm focused, enjoying racing fellow hobbyjoggers and the atmosphere. There are animation points but no live bands or anything fancy like that. The crowd is very supportive.

#### half - KM 30: 2:06:13
Things are going on uneventful. At KM 24 I take my third GU.

Somewhere before KM 28 or maybe even earlier is the place in a marathon where you know there's still a long way to go and you see a runner winning slowly meters on you. Very slowly. And every time you'd ask yourself if you should go with him or just let him go. And you have time to evaluate and think about it. And you see him still gaining distance.

Every-time the answer should be to stick with him. And it's what I did. Made an effort, matched his pace and the started to close. Slowly. And all of the sudden I'm in a full blown [cherry-picking mode](https://cloud259.com/2017/11/15/episode-60-allie-kieffer-and-the-2017-nyc-marathon/). Don't know what happened with that guy or if he even existed and it doesn't matter because I'm still in the race.

#### KM 30-finish: 2:57:09
KM 33 is where I take the last GU. I'm racing, holding back and waiting that out and back section where we would pass that under-pass. Twice. Out and back. On the other side of the road I see KM 37 and I'm still at 34. And somehow I start to think that once at 37 I'll have only 5k to go. And maybe then I can pickup the pace a bit. Is like the next 3k to actually get there and the under-pass that had to be done twice didn't even exist. Things are getting a bit blurry but my pace stays the same as before. I'm convinced I'll PR and finish under 3.

With 4k to go I start to think in miles. 2 is less than 4, just because is a small number. A quick glimpse at the watch and I accidentally drop a 4:00/k split (39 to 40k) but that was all the juice I had left so I'm back on cruising mode to the finish line. A sharp 180° turn and the final 200m on the track. I celebrate Shelane style.

### Post-race
I cross the finish line and collapse for the drama right in a puddle. I'm actually ok. I'm actually very surprised I'm ok. I hang around at the finish line for a few minutes waiting some team mates to arrive and exchange running courtesies with everyone around. Got the medal. Then pick the bag. Eat and drink all the things they gave us.

### Next
I'm going to take at least a week off running. Maybe two. So my dear strava friends: I'm very ok, just need some days off and I'll be back at it.

Then, I'll probably do a 1h on the track part of a 24h team relay event. And in March I'll run the Barcelona Marathon to celebrate my 10 years living in this city.
