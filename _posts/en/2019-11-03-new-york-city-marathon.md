### Background

I'm writing this race report now, more than two months after the actual race, so I can finnaly turn the page and move on to the next chapter. I had previously wrote pieces of it and hopefully glueing them toghether will help me keep the images and the feelings I had that day for as long as I can. All those wednsdaysummer mornings waking up at 5:30am to fit an workout before work, the heat, the humidity and the taste of caffeinated SiS GO drink. How was I feeling entering Cental Park? How did Bronx smelled that day? And most important, what did I learned after this experience?

Running the 6 Majors is on everyone's goal list and I'm no exception. Getting a time qualifier for the New York City marathon was my A goal when I ran the Boston marathon back in 2017. At that time, I needed to run sub 2h 55 to get in, but after a great build up where I felt I was in the required shape to do it, the race day turned very warm and I finished in 3h 09, a humbling experience with 9 minutes positive split. Next attempt was in October 2018 at the Oxford half marathon where I managed to punch the ticket for New York 2019, this time with easier time qualifing standards because I changed the age category.

### Training

2018 was my best running year so far with PRs in both half in October and marathon in December.
