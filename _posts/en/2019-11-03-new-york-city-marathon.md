### Background

I'm writing this race report now, months after the actual race, so I can finally turn the page and move on to the next chapter. I had previously wrote pieces of it and hopefully glueing them together will help me keep the images and the feelings I had that day for as long as I can. All those Wednesday summer mornings waking up at 5:30am to fit a workout before work, the heat, the humidity and the taste of caffeinated SiS GO drink. How was I feeling entering Central Park? How did Bronx smelled that day? And most important, what did I learned after this experience?

Running the 6 Majors is on everyone's goal list and I'm no exception. Getting a time qualifier for the New York City marathon was my A goal when I ran the Boston marathon back in 2017. At that time, I needed to run sub 2h 55 to get in, but after a great build up where I felt I was in the required shape to do it, the race day turned very warm and I finished in 3h 09, a humbling experience with 9 minutes positive split. Next attempt was in October 2018 at the Oxford half marathon where I managed to punch the ticket for New York 2019, this time with easier time qualifying standards because I changed the age category.

### Training

2018 was my best running year (so far) with PRs in Oxford half marathon (1:23) in October and Pisa marathon (2:56) in December. It was a great wrap up for 2 stringed years of running. Without a spring marathon in 2019, there were some niggles I wanted to focus on, especially the Achilles tendinitis I've been battling with since April 2018.

In January 2019, I visited a specialist to get an assesment of my running gait and have some strenght and conditioning program prescribed. My gait turned okaish, there were some but not major imbalances between left and right sides. The strength program was bodyweight with lots of planks, bridges and single leg proprioception exercises. I started this program at the beginning of February, at that time doing it 3 times per week (M/W/Sa) as well as running 50-70km/week with 1 workout (F) and a long run or race (Su). On 3rd of February I ran a half in 1:27:40 and a week later I did the BCN half in 1:27:02. The Achilles tendinitis wasn't getting any better.

Friday 15th of February I went for a workout, 6x800@CV with 45" recovery. I sat in my car in the parking lot checking the internet on my mobile for at least 30' before I got out to do my run. I was so burned out and it hurt so much and November was still so far away that I decided to just stop running until I felt better.

Over the next 6 weeks, running was minimal. But beside those 3 days doing my bodyweight routine at home, I also started to hit the gym twice per week(W/F). And sometimes, after work I was doing 40-50' of eliptical / stationary bike. I've got stronger but my cardio diminished and a lot. By April, I was back running 3-4 times / week, short and easy runs usually stopping mid-way to do some plyometric exercises and form drills. There was a progressive increase of running volume, but in yet another case of too much too soon, on 12th of May after a 2h long run I was feeling the same discomfort in the Achilles area as in February.
