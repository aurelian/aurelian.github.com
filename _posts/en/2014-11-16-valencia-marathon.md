### Training

I guess I took the decision to run my first marathon in March while volunteering at the water stop at the kilometer 38 of Barcelona's marathon. Maybe motivated by a desire to find why mostly everyone seamed to enjoy racing this distance on a miserable day for running (it was very hot). I have been constantly jogging since 2012 and my progress at shorter distances has been accordingly culminating in May when I went under 41:00 for 10km after a chaining a few weeks of running more than 50km/week.

I evaluated a few training programs and finally decided to go with the beginner's plan from Hanson's Marathon Method book drown by the shorter long runs (26km) compared with other plans. I was a bit worried about how I would go from running 50km/week to a 92km peak without getting hurt and it turned out I learned fairly soon to keep the easy days easy, otherwise it would have been impossible to hit the workout paces and the cumulated volume at the prescribed level.

I plugged in the Hansons calculator the paces for a **3:08** marathon and started the plan on 11th of August fiting the last 14 weeks of it. Speed and strength workours were all a bit faster than prescribed, tempo runs were OK, but the paces started to drift to slower edge after accumulating a few weeks above 80km/week. I did a tune-up half at MP and PRd on a very challanging course, effort wise it felt more than MP but I was happy with the outcome. Overall, I missed 4 runs out of 84 and I totalled about 1000km.
