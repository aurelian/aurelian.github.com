### Training

I guess I took the decision to run my first marathon in March while volunteering at the water stop at kilometer 38 of Barcelona's marathon motivated by a desire to find why mostly everyone seamed to enjoy racing this distance on a misserable day for running (it was very hot).

Been running constantly since 2012 and my progress at shorter distances has been accordingly, in May I went under 41:00 for 10km after a chaining a few weeks of running more than 50km/week.

I evaluated a few training programs and finnaly decided to go with the beginner's plan from Hanson's Marathon Method book drown by the shorter long run (26km) compared with other plans. I was a bit worried about how would I go from running 50km/week to a 92km peak without getting hurt and it turned out I learned soon to keep the easy days easy, otherwise would have been impossible to hit the worout paces and the cumulated volume at the prescribed level.

The plan started on 11th of August and I could fit last 14 weeks of it.
